You are a senior Vite + React + TypeScript engineer.

Your task is to fully fix ALL broken import paths in this project so it builds without errors.

Project structure rules (VERY IMPORTANT)

The project root contains a src/ directory.

ALL frontend code lives inside src/.

src/ is the module root — never include src in import paths.

All imports inside src/ must use only:

./ (same folder)

../ (one level up)

Never use:

/src/...

../src/...

../../ unless the file is actually nested two folders deep (most are not).

Actual folder tree (ground truth)

Mandatory import rules by location
From src/App.tsx

Use:

./screens/...
./panels/...
./hooks/...
./storage/...
./context/...
./types

From src/screens/*

Use:

../components/...
../services/...
../hooks/...
../types

From src/panels/*

Use:

../components/...
../services/...
../types

From src/components/*

Use:

../services/...
../types

From src/services/*

Use:

../types

What you must do

Scan every .ts and .tsx file inside src/

Fix all invalid import paths according to the rules above

Fix case-sensitive filename mismatches (Linux filesystem)

Ensure these specific files resolve correctly:

services/auraLLM.ts

services/matchService.ts

screens/MatchChatScreen.tsx

types.ts

Do NOT change logic, UI, or functionality — ONLY imports

Do NOT introduce path aliases

Do NOT move files unless absolutely required to fix imports

End state (success criteria)

npm run dev starts with zero Vite import-analysis errors

No Failed to resolve import messages

App renders normally

Proceed carefully, systematically, and fix everything.
